        - A believable but memorable and funny core situation/scenario, that can be used to create a hilarious prank call situation.
        - A caller/character that is fitting for the scenario and supports its humorous aspects.

        - Be highly relevant to the scenario, character and the prank call dynamics.
        - Stay true to the original description.

        IMPORTANT:
        - The caller is NOT known by the target unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
        - DO NOT ASK ABOUT ANY specific characteristics, reactions, answers, or behaviors, quriks, etc. of the target.
        - DO not include a set of specific ideas, direct quotes, lines, etc. to choose from 
        - No simple yes/no questions.
        - Do not ask about the relationship between the prankster and the target.
        - Do not ask for specific quotes, questions, responses or any other direct line for the character.

        Your goal: Generate 2-4 clarifying questions that add the aspects of the NECESSARY CONTENT of the scenario and character that are missing.
